                        <p class="ans">As soon as the app is released, you can sign in by using Feide. We have chosen Feide because 97%
                            of Norway's elementary school and high school students have a user on Feide. If you can't login
                            via Feide, you can always sign up with your e-mail address inside our app.</p>

                        <p class="ans">Friminutt is a free service. We encourage activities that are free, but we have partners who contribute
                            to the cause. This gives us the opportunity to arrange events and activities that would normally
                            cost money. If you would like to contribute to the organization you can e-mail us at
                            <a class="mail-link" href="mailto:post.friminutt@gmail.com?Subject=Free%20app" target="_top">post.friminutt@gmail.com</a>.</p>

                        <p class="ans">The service is not anonymous. You need to login with your Feide user account. This is to avoid abuse
                            of the service. It is not possible for other users to see your profile, only your mentor will
                            know your identity.</p>

                        <p class="ans">Most mentors are students from colleges and universities. They have very different backgrounds and
                            interests, but one thing they all have in common is that they want to be there for you!</p>

                        <p class="ans">The mentor that is assigned to you, is based on your interests and hobbies. If you are not satisfied
                            with your assigned mentor, we will help you find a mentor that is right for you. </p>

                        <p class="ans">To become a mentor you can go to the <a class="mail-link" href="../mentor/">mentor page</a> and read about the requirements. You can leave your
                            e-mail and we will get back to you within a few days to discuss your interest. We hope you will
                            join us!

                        <p class="ans">Yes, communication between you and your mentor will be confidential. We will save the chat
                            history for quality assurance. This is done to prevent misuse of the service. Should the informationt
                            a mentor receives be of such character that it might endanger other peoples life or health, we
                            will contact the parents or the authorities. The content of a chat will never be used for marketing
                            or commercial purposes.</p>
