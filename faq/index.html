                        <p class="ans">As soon as the app is released, you can sign in by using Feide. We have chosen Feide because 97%
                            of Norway's elementary school and high school students have a user on Feide. If you do not have
                            the ability to log in by using Feide you can sign up in our app, or contact us at

                            <span id="costmoney"></span>Is the app free?</h2>
                        <p class="ans">Yes, Friminutt is a free service. We encourage activities that are free, but we have partners who
                            contribute to the cause. This gives us the opportunity to arrange events and activities that
                            would normally cost money. If you would like to contribute to the organization you can e-mail
                            us at

                        <p class="ans">All students in elementary school and high school can participate. It requires a Feide user to sign
                            in, but if your school does not offer this, you can send a e-mail to
                            <a class="mail-link" href="mailto:post.friminutt@gmail.com?Subject=Participation"

                        <p class="ans">The service is not anonymous. You need to login with your Feide user. This is to avoid abuse of the
                            service. It will not be possible for other users to see your profile, and only your mentor will
                            know your identity.</p>

                        <p class="ans">Most mentors are students from colleges and universities. They have very different backgrounds and
                            interests, but one thing they all have in common is that they want to be there for you!</p>

                        <p class="ans">The mentor that is assigned to you, is based on your interests and hobbies. If you are not satisfied
                            with your assigned mentor, we will help you find a mentor that is right for you. </p>

                        <p class="ans">To become a mentor you can og to the mentor page and read about the requirements. You can leave your
                            email and we will get back to you within a few days to discuss your interest. We hope you will

                        <p class="ans">Yes, what you and your mentor are talking about will be confidential, but we save the chat history
                            for quality assurance. This is also done to prevent misuse of the service. Should the informationt
                            a mentor receives be of such character that it might endanger other peoples life or health, we
                            will contact the parents or the authorities. The content of a chat will never be used for marketing
                            or commercial use.</p>
