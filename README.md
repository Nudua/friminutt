Ramstad](https://github.com/Nudua), [Håkon Åreskjold](https://github.com/hakoares), [Kristoffer Farstad](https://github.com/Lakriz88), [Anders Gorboe](https://github.com/gorboe) and [Si-Jane Woo](https://github.com/sidjwoo).  
It was written in pure HTML5, CSS and some JavaScript because of the requirements from the assignment.

## Background
Final Project in "Webprosjekt DAFE 1200" at Oslomet - Storbyuniversitetet. The Project is a collaboration between 5 students, 
and is created mostly with HTML and CSS. We used very little Javascript due to demands regarding universal design. The webpage needed 
to be accessible for "everyone".

The project is focusing on children suffering from isolation and lack of friends. We believe that we can be an important piece 
of the puzzle in the fight against loneliness, and to be a positive force in children's lives.

## Features
* Fully Responsive design.
* Universal design.
* Accessible website.
* An important cause.
