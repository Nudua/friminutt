                    <p class="ans questions">The world we live in is a world always in a hurry. Most children grow up doing just fine, but some faces problems no one should have to face, and least of all children. The feeling of loneliness is a challenge many people face in todays society. In particular, many children and adolescent has experienced loneliness growing up. This can be the children who are bullied, do not have any friends, cannot handle the percieved pressure that both they and the world put on their shoulders, or children who do not receive answers to all of their questions in life. If this problem is not dealt with on an early stage, the damage done can be irreparable.</p>

                    <p class="ans questions">As human beings, we were never designed to be alone. We have always lived in packs, and although our society is trying to isolate us from one another, there is still feelings of togetherness rooted deep within our soul. And when we're at our most vulnerable, this need to belong is enhanced. </p>

                    <p class="ans questions">Children are shaped by their childhood years, and to be ostracized is something that they're going to carry with them throughout life. When children first get into a vicious circle it is difficult to get out, just because people form an impression and categorizes people. We believe that we can be an important piece of the puzzle in the fight against loneliness, and to be a positive force in childrens life.</p>
