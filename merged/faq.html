                        <p class="ans">You can sign in by using Feide. We have chosen Feide because 97% of Norway's elementary school and
                            high school students have a user on Feide. If you do not have the ability to log in by using
                            Feide you can sign up in our app, or contact us at post.friminutt@gmail.com.</p>

                            <span id="costmoney"></span>Is it free?</h2>
                        <p class="ans">Yes, Friminutt is a free service. We encourage activities that are free, but we have Partners who
                            sometimes contribute to the cause. This gives us the opportunity to arrange events and activities
                            that would normally cost money. Businesses that would like to contribute to the organization
                            can e-mail us at post.friminutt@gmail.com.</p>

                        <p class="ans">All students in elementary school and high school can participate. It requires a Feide-bruker to
                            sign in, but if your school does not offer this, you can send a e-mail to support@friminutt.no.</p>

                        <p class="ans">The service is not anonymous. You need to login with your Feide user. This is to avoid abuse of the
                            service. It will not be possible for other users to see your profile, and only your mentor will
                            know your identity.</p>

                        <p class="ans">Most mentors are students from colleges and universities. They have very different backgrounds and
                            interests, but one thing they all have in common is that they want to be here for you!</p>

                        <p class="ans">Mentor that is assigned to you, is based on your interests and hobbies. If you are not satisfied
                            with your mentor, we will help you find a mentor that is right for you. </p>

                        <p class="ans">To become a mentor you can og to the mentor page "mentor" located under the page "Solution". There
                            you will find information about the requirements to become a mentor. We hope you will join us!

                        <p class="ans">No, what you and your mentor are talking about will be confidential, but we save the chat history
                            to be able to ensure that the work we do holds a high quality. This is also done to prevent misuse
                            of the service. Should the information, that a mentor receives, be of such character that it
                            might have an impact on people's life and health, we will contact the parents or the authorities
                            for support. The contents of a chat will never be used for marketing or commercial use.</p>
