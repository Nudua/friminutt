                        Students from all over Norway can sign up to become a mentor in our Organization, to become a mentor they need to answer
                        a small survey so that we get review whether the person is suitable or not to be a mentor. Then,
                        they will be called into an interview where we ask about their motivation, why they would like to
                        become a mentor and if they have any prior experience with something similar. Then the candidates
                        are summoned to a private case training, a little review on how to behave, and how not to behave,
                        and what to do if something bad happens. Finally, all must deliver a police certificate of conduct
                        and get certification proof from us that they are an approved mentor. It is a big responsibility
                        and a lot of trusts that is required, therefore it is important that we are thorough.

                    It is only a few years ago since our mentors were young and had to find out of all the difficult challenges children are
                    facing, and that is exactly why they are best qualified to do the job. Our mentors are energy-rich, spontaneous
                    and big-hearted people. They want to do new things and are exelent at adapting to situations, and adapting
                    to people. They have the ability to give a push in the right direction, challenge, inspire, and help
                    children in difficult periods.
