						<p>The mentor program should be offered to children and young people who do not feel at home in everyday life. Mentor the program be offered to those who experience bullying, loneliness, a sense of being overwhelmed in the school context and pressure from both themselves and others in terms of how you have to present to be successful. We want to make a difference in the lives of children and young people, and show them that there are experiences to look forward to in the future.</p>

						<p>Mentor the scheme will be a portal for children and young people, in the form of an app, where they can meet the students from the University and College. Here they can get answers to their questions, experience new impulses, get help to develop socially, and meeting mentors. The idea is to create value in the everyday lives of those who do not see their own value. There will be different levels of involvement from both the students and mentors his side. For example, users can choose to simply ask a question, or you can have a conversation with a mentor.</p>
