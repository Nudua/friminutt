                    <h2>A different solution</h2>
                    <p>The mentor program should be offered to children and young people who do not feel at home in everyday life. Mentor the program be offered to those who experience bullying, loneliness, a sense of being overwhelmed in the school context and pressure from both themselves and others in terms of how you have to present to be successful. We want to make a difference in the lives of children and young people, and show them that there are experiences to look forward to in the future.</p>

                    <p>We at Recess believe that all children and young people have the right to a childhood with good memory, and someone to share them with. We believe that everyone deserves a friend you can talk to when needed. Through the mentor program you can meet our mentors and share your thoughts and experiences with them. The way we do this is through our kind and easy-going mentors from the University and colleges who meets and talks to  thousands of children and young people from all over Norway every day. </p>

                    <p>Mentor the scheme will be a portal for children and young people, in the form of an app, where they can meet the students from the University and College. Here they can get answers to their questions, experience new impulses, get help to develop socially, and meeting mentors. The idea is to create value in the everyday lives of those who do not see their own value. There will be different levels of involvement from both the students and mentors his side. For example, users can choose to simply ask a question, or you can have a conversation with a mentor.</p>

                    <p>All students will log in using the feud, so that one cannot remain anonymous. This is to avoid that the service is not abused. It will not be possible for users to find each other, and only mentors and Friminutt will know the identity of the users. Information about students is of course confidential, and all the volunteers it is confidential as long as it does not lead to that a user or anyone around the user becomes corrupted.</p>

                    <p>A user and a mentor will be matched through the interests and gender. We try to pair up students and mentors so that they are of the same gender as far as possible. The start will take place in the contact on the internet, and it has a separate room to talk together as only a mentor and student use. The conversation is saved for quality assurance, and to avoid abuse of the service. If it is desirable for the user, meetings can be arranged between the mentor and  the user student. If so, the parents or  is required or parental approval, and we recommend that parents/guardians are with the first meeting, so that one gets met, and mentor can get get to know that person.</p>
